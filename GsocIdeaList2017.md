#NLP project:

W6 project helps analyst to gather data from unstructured reports on violent actions. It makes a suggestion to analyst on what happened
and he/she should validate if article was parse correctly and add data if needed. 
Bits that we are gathering right now are from a crime: victim and doer, type of a crime e.g murder, kidnap etc., 
location and time of an event, what wearpon were used.
Right now we have pretty simple implementation of data extraction you can see code [here](src/main/java/com/w6/nlp)
We are looking for a student, who is willing to improve implementation and make it more reliable by creating test cases.

#UX/UI project
Insecurity insight is humanitarian organisation that provides information about violence against aid worker around the world.
In order to do this they go through unstructured report to fetch interested bit of information. You can help our project by imporoving
user experience of a website. Three main goals of ux/ui improvement for a summer project could be:

Make better highlighting of text based on natural language proccessing data, so analyst will faster get relevant data from a text

Visaulise data using chart and maps, so gathered data can be seen as interactive chart.

Create automaticly generated report page, so analyst will not spend their time compiling reports.

# Infrastucture project
w6 goal is to be a tool for different organisation that make news based statistics. Different organisation have different proposes
and same article might be relevant to one and irrelevent to another. The biggest challenge is that most of a time rules that difines 
how to procced data is a huge guide line, that is not that easy to be translated into rules. 
Goal of this project is to crete flexible infrusture 
that will actively learn from user input. It will make tool give more and more precise prediction during usage of a system and make process 
of gathering data quicker and cheaper.
